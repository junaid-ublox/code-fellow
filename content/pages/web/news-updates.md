      ### **Launching of automated C﻿SP generator and evaluator**


      CSP Evaluator allows developers and security experts to check if a Content Security Policy (CSP) serves as a strong mitigation against \[cross-site scripting attacks]. 


      It assists with the process of reviewing CSP policies, which is usually a manual task, and helps identify subtle CSP bypasses which undermine the value of a policy. 


      CSP Evaluator checks are based on a [large-scale study](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub45542.html) and are aimed to help developers to harden their CSP and improve the security of their applications.
